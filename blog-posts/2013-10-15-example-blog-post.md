# Example blog post

Hello! This is an example blog post. I'm writing it in a format called
Markdown, because I think Markdown is a nice format for writing text
documents. You can tell it's Markdown by the `.md` file extension.

You can edit this file by clicking "Edit" in the GitHub web interface,
or by using `git`. Grab a developer if you want a hand, as always.

## This is a subheading (it's got two hash symbols)

By writing our blog posts like this, we can get people to proofread them
before they're published. If you want to get feedback, send a link to your
blog post. People can send pull requests for typos, or any other change.

Like most other things, this is entirely optional. I just think it
would be a pretty good way of working.

Have fun,

Alex

PS File formats are also up for grabs; HTML might be good.
